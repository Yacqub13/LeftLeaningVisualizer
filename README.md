LeftLeaningRedBlackTreeVisualization


# This is my Left-Leaning Red-Black Tree (LLRB Tree) Visualization Tool, which I built in Java using the DrawingPanel library. It allows you to input integers to construct a self-balancing binary search tree. The tree maintains its balance through rotations and color flips, following Red-Black Tree properties. I used the DrawingPanel to create a graphical visualization that updates dynamically after each insertion, showing the treeâ€™s structure with nodes color-coded as red or black and connected by edges. This project is a great way to demonstrate how LLRB Trees work and to visualize the balancing process in real time.
